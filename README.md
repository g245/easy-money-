Description:
The Easy Money app gives customers easy cash access using only the mobile app. It
allows cardless cash withdrawals that allows customers make ATM withdrawals using
their mobile app, with no need to use a debit card. The customers can pre-order cash
from the app anytime and anywhere.
It is much faster than getting your card, entering your PIN, selecting all the required
options and so on. It provides a quick access cardless cash functionality with a onetime use code.
It cuts the transaction time from an average 3 minutes to under 1 minute.
This service has a per-transaction withdrawal limit of Rs.10,000 and a daily limit of
Rs.20,000.
Steps:
1. You have to open the mobile app on the smart phone.
2. Signup to the app, where the you will be required to add the bank account
number and the registered mobile number, if you have already signed up the
login to the app.
3. Then you can find the ATM nearest to you by selecting ‘Nearest ATM’ where
you will see the nearest ATMs on a map.
4. To enter the amount for cash withdrawal select ‘Request Cash’, where you have
to select the account type and the amount and then select ‘Next’.
5. Then you have to generate a six digit PIN, which should not be shared with
anyone. This six digit PIN will be valid for the next 30 minutes that will allow you
to use ATM without a card.
6. On ATM use the registered mobile number and the six-digit PIN generated for
cardless transaction.
7. The ATM receives the authorization of transaction and dispenses cash.
Benefits:
1. Cardless cash withdrawals give you the ability to travel light.
2. In case of emergencies like if you have left your wallet at home, you can still
continue to have access to your cash.
3. There is no additional cost for using it, as the app works the same as a debit
card when withdrawing money.
4. It provides increased security as the code is only for a one-time use, with debit
cards you use the same code each time you use it.
5. It also eliminates the threat of skimming and shoulder-surfing for stealing
information at the ATM.
